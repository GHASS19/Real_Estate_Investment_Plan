# Real Estate Investment Plan

### In this case study I used the Realtor.com database that had 207,571 home sales information from 10 states plus Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The database was over 25 mb and I could not upload to GitHub. I can share the database if you need to see it. 

### The main focus of this case study is find a state and certain traits for a house to invest in as a rental property utilizing this dataset. 

### We have four main questions to answer:

                        1. Which state should we buy an investment property in?
                        
                        2. How many bedrooms and bathrooms should the house have?
                        
                        3. What is the median & mean price of houses?
                        
                        4. What traits do the houses have in common?
